Hey! I'm Lucas, aka Luulas-bot, and this is my github, where i will be uploading every project I'm into. 

-Actually I'm learning a lot of python stuff and programming as well, but in the future, I would like to get to know other languages. I'm interested in
projects where I can learn from.  

-I'm currently learning python, pygame, SQL, JAVAScript and HTML.

-If someone wants to do a collaboration and the project is cool, I'm in.

If you want to reach me for  collaborative projects or doubts, you can write me to lucas.lengy@gmail.com

Hope you like my repository.
