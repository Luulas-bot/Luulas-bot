Hey! I'm Lucas, aka Luulas-bot, and this is my github, where i will be uploading every project I'm into. 

-Actually I'm learning a lot of python stuff and programming as well whit this language, but in the future, I would like to know many other languages. I'm intrested into whatever
project, the main condition is that it needs to be something cool to do and learn from. 

-I'm currently learning python, pygame, SQL, JAVAScript and HTML.

-If someone wants to do a collaboration and the project is cool, I'm in.

If you want to talk to me or reach me for a collaboration or other doubts, you can write me an email at this adress: linyeravago@gmail.com

Hope you like my repository.
